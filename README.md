# RIPER Tools 
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://riper-tools.streamlit.app/)

This [web app](https://riper-tools.streamlit.app/) allows you to create input files for the `RIPER` module of [TURBOMOLE](https://www.turbomole.org/) by selecting a material in the [materialsproject.org](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/) database or a molecule in the [PubChem database](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
It also allows conversion from various file formats like `CIF`, `XYZ`, `POSCAR`, `CAR`, and `PWSCF` to the `RIPER` format making it easier to adapt TURBOMOLE in your existing workflows.
You can also use it to get help with `RIPER` related examples, keywords, references, and tutorials.

The `RIPER` module is an implementation of Kohn-Sham DFT with Gaussian-type orbitals
(GTO) as basis functions that treats molecular and periodic systems of any dimensionality on an equal footing.

This GitHub repo contains all the source code of a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web application for helping you set up DFT calculations for `RIPER`. 


## Web App
The web app is available at [https://riper-tools.streamlit.app/](https://riper-tools.streamlit.app/).

**Hint**: Use the sidebar menu on the left to navigate between different options.

## Contributors
The app was originally created by me (https://github.com/manassharma07/) but now also contains contributions from https://github.com/Lexachoc.

## About me
I am a fourth-year PhD student in Physics at [Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) Germany](https://www.uni-jena.de/), advised by [Prof. Dr. Marek Sierka](https://www.cmsg.uni-jena.de/) (CEO [TURBOMOLE](https://www.turbomole.org/)).
My passion lies in developing codes and methods to model the light-matter interaction of hybrid systems.
